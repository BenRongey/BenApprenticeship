# Revelry Apprentice
This repo will cover relevant topics to the Software Apprentice at Revelry Labs.  The bredth of topics comes from Revelry's own wiki and Apprentice tutorial repos and wiki, plus some of my own selection

## Issues
The list of 40+ issues was auto created via script from Revelry Labs.

## Elixir
The [Elixir folder](https://github.com/BenRongey/BenApprenticeship/tree/master/elixir) at this time is just a run through of the Elixir Guide from the [Elixir Lang website](https://elixir-lang.org/)

### Additional Work Areas
Additional work is needed for the best possible understanding of:
* [Keyword Lists](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/keywords-and-maps.html#keyword-lists)
* When to use which Elixir data structure in general ([maybe learn this](https://dev.to/talum/which-data-structure-should-i-use-an-elixir-cheat-sheet-3epe))
* Anonymous / Lambda Functions
